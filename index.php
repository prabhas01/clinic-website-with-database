						<p class="text-justify">Blood is universally recognized as the most precious element that sustains life. It saves innumerable lives across the world in a variety of conditions. The need for blood is great - on any given day, approximately 39,000 units of Red Blood Cells are needed. More than 29 million units of blood components are transfused every year. Donate Blood Despite the increase in the number of donors, blood remains in short supply during emergencies, mainly attributed to the lack of information and accessibility. We positively believe this tool can overcome most of these challenges by effectively connecting the blood donors with the blood recipients.

				According to the latest Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, 1975-2014, overall cancer death rates continue to decrease in men, women, and children for all major racial and ethnic groups. But more work remains for some cancers.

				<p>The Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors (ROCS) study, which will include 5,560 cancer survivors, will look at the major factors affecting cancer progression, recurrence, mortality, and quality of life among African-American cancer survivors.
				<br><hr></p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>Premature death rates declined among Hispanics, blacks, and Asian/Pacific Islanders due mainly to fewer deaths from cancer, heart disease, and HIV. Rising deaths from accidents, drug overdoses, suicide and liver disease increased rates among whites and American Indian/Alaska Natives.
				<br><hr></p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>Investigators with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network have identified novel genomic and molecular characteristics of cervical cancer that will aid in subclassification of the disease and may help target therapies that are most appropriate for each patient.
				<br><hr></p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) today launched a new drug formulary (the "NCI Formulary") that will enable investigators at NCI-designated Cancer Centers to have quicker access to approved and investigational agents for use in preclinical studies and cancer clinical trials. The NCI Formulary could ultimately translate into speeding the availability of more-effective treatment options to patients with cancer.<br><hr></p>
